        <h2>About the City <i class="fas fa-vihara"></i></h2>
        
           <p>Kyoto is a huge city with several district articles containing sightseeing, restaurant, nightlife  and accommodation listings.
            Kyoto <span>(京都)</span> was the capital of Japan for over a millennium, and carries a reputation as its most beautiful city and the nation's cultural capital. However, visitors may be surprised by how much work they will have to do to see Kyoto's beautiful side. Most first impressions of the city will be of the urban sprawl of central Kyoto, around the ultra-modern glass-and-steel train station, which is itself an example of a city steeped in tradition mixing with the modern world.</p><br>
            <p>Nonetheless, the persistent visitor will soon discover Kyoto's hidden beauty in the temples and parks which ring the city center, and find that the city has much more to offer than immediately meets the eye. There are over 2000 temples and shrines in the city, and nobody sees it all in one visit (or two, or three...) - nor should you even try. It would take months if not years to see all that Kyoto has to offer, and many places are especially beautiful during certain seasons, like the plum blossoms, cherry blossoms, autumn leaves, etc. These give very different impressions and appearances, and you can visit Kyoto again and again, yet still be amazed to see something new.</p>

            <h2>Getting Around <i class="fas fa-shoe-prints"></i></h2>
       
        <p>Travel within Kyoto can look complicated and to a point it is. The city is served by multiple rail companies, including the Kyoto City subway, Hankyu, Kintetsu, Keihan, Eizan, Randen, and city buses. There are great sights to see in every corner of the city, and no one single company can take you to all of them. In addition there are some bicycle rentals, and taxis are ubiquitous.
            One of the easiest ways to plan a route is through Hyperdia or Japan Transit Planner. These websites contain station-to-station route plans, which reference public and private trains and subways as well as buses throughout Japan. It is also easy for Japan Rail Pass users to exclude all Nozomi trains from their searches.
            By subway: There are two subway lines which only serve a rather small part of the city.
            By bus: The bus network is the only practical way of reaching some attractions, particularly those in northwestern Kyoto. Destinations are electronically displayed/announced in English as well as Japanese.
            By bicycle: Particularly in spring and fall, getting around by bicycle can be a good option. Cycling forms a major form of personal transport year-round for locals. The city's grid layout makes navigation easy. You can rent bicycles in many places in Japan for a reasonable price.</p>

           <h2>Etiquette & customs <i class="fas fa-handshake-slash"></i></h2>
           <p>Manners are very important amongst the Japanese. You should make sure you are aware of the basic rules.
            In Japan, people greet each other by bowing. The bow ranges from a small nod of the head (casual and informal) to a deep bend at the waist (indicating respect). A bow of the head from a foreigner is usually sufficient; most Japanese people don’t expect foreigners to know the bowing rules. Shaking hands in Japan is uncommon.
            There are strict rules regarding indoor manners in Japan which are related to footwear. Shoes are removed not only in the home, but also in many traditional ryokan (Japanese style inns), some restaurants, temples, castles and other historic buildings.
            When dining out, many restaurants have a mixture of both Western style tables and chairs as well as low traditional tables, where it’s usual to sit on a pillow (this type of dining is referred to as “zashiki”).
            Chopsticks are used to eat most kinds of Japanese food and these should be held towards their end, not in the middle or front third.
            It’s not customary to tip in Japan. Instead it’s polite to say “gochisosama deshita” (“thank you for the meal”) when leaving.

        <h2>Local culture</h2>  
        <p>Japan has a fascinating and multifaceted culture; on the one hand it is immersed in the deepest of traditions dating back thousands of years, and on the other it is a society in a continual state of rapid change, with constantly shifting trends and fashions and technological development that perpetually tests and pushes boundaries. This is part of what makes it such a fascinating country to visit.</p>

    <div id="right-about">
        <h2>The Japanese Language</h2>
        <p>Japanese is spoken by about 125 million speakers. Not much is known of the language’s history, or even when it first appeared in Japan; substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. Japanese has no genetic relationship with Chinese, however it makes extensive use of Chinese characters (kanji) and a large portion of its vocabulary is borrowed from the Chinese language.

    <div id="center-about">
        <h2>Clothing</h2>
        <p>There are typically 2 types of clothing which the Japanese wear. While the traditional ethnic garments of Japan like kimonos are still in use, they are mainly worn for ceremonies and special events like funerals and festivals. More recently, western clothing is worn often in day-to-day life.</p>
