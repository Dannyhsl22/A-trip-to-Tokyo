## UX

This website has been created as a one page front end website with scrolling behaviour for overview of travel information, historic and cultural sites and what a contact form.

The website shows at first the logo and a landscape of Kyoto to atract the user and so they can expect to see and potentially acquire more on the site.


The flow goes below to a section introducing and explaining more about Kyoto, on how to move around and knowing more about customs to engage visitors in a site that not encourages visiting Kyoto city but learning about the culture and history. 

Then, the historic sites section appears with a selection of famous building images. This gallery displays in a modal with easy navigation, giving a smooth navigation feeling.

The Contact Us section is a form with "required fields".

There is a newsletter subscription to get latest updates by email, and over the in social media icons.

 ### Site fluidity 
To test the flow of the site I forwarded it on to my spouse and work colleagues. After some proding I asked for peer review within my P1 slack channel. Grammarly was also used to test the various pages for any spelling and grammar errors.
 <hr>

### Browser Compatibility
I tested the compatibility of my site first by by emulating different devices using the Dev tools in Chrome as well as using the variable responsive setting to check at different breakpoints. 
* The various tests that were run were:
    * checking to see if the all images and cards scaled and maintained aspect ratio as the display shrunk and grew.
    * checking to see if responsive elements within my layout changed at the correct breakpoints, such as the navbar and cards.
    * checking to see if my media queries behaved as expected with regards to cards displaying in columns or rows, navigation.  

I then tested it on different browsers.

## Deployment

## Credits
* A big shout out to my mentor, **Akshat Garg**, for guding me through the process and offering assistance when neccesary to point me in the right direction.

* The community on **Slack**, the contect on there is a really great tool to use when stuck on problems.

### Content
* Much of the information regarding Kyoto, its styles and origins where taken from various wikipedia articles [Kyoto Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto) and [kwintessential](https://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/guide-to-japan-etiquette-customs-culture-business)

* The color was inspired by running various searches through google with the keyword **Kyoto/japan** and then further refined with the help of sites such as [material](material.io).

* The fonts were acquired via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
<hr>

### Media
* The images used throughout the site were sourced from an open source gallery in [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/kyoto/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/kyoto).

* The animation used on the landing page was inspired by the deisgn used in the **Love Running** project. It was modified to suit the needs of this site.

* Icons used throughout the site for social media were sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&q=social)
<hr>

### Other Resources
* To better add to my understanding, markdown syntax was reseached from [Markdown Syntax](https://dotcms.com/docs/latest/markdown-syntax) to aid in compiling and styiling this README document.

* While most programming happened at unsocialable hours, when I really got stuck the web is an invaluable resource too, I did a fair amount of review on [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) Concepts like as the **margins, grid and images**
